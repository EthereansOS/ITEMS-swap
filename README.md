# Uniswap Interface forked to trade the Where is my Dragon? card game

## Card view

In this fork we changed the view of tokens, so you can see perfectly the cards illustrations and read the token name, instead of the token symbol.

## WIMD card list

We added a standard list in the dropdown menu with all of the WIMD cards.
